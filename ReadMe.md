# **The 7 Catalysts --- Core Identity**

- 1 *Active Catalyst* (equipped / Attuned)
- 2 *Bound Catalysts* (passive AI units)
- You issue **commands**, not micromanage
- **1 Active Catalyst** → modifies weapon + grants Signature Spell
- **2 Passive Catalysts** → autonomous, evasive, light attacks
- Command one of the 2 Catalyst to cast its spell (Q/E/1/2)
- Equipped Catalyst = Attunement
  Each Catalyst is defined by:
- **Primary Gain** --- what players actively want
- **Secondary Effects** --- supporting stats (HP, CDR, accuracy, etc.)
- **Distortion / Penalty** --- why pure builds are dangerous
- **Design Role** --- the gameplay fantasy it fulfills

## [🔥 Wrath](🔥ᜃ KA - Wrath (Fire) "wikilink")

- **On-hit effect:** **Burn** --- damage-over-time fire effect, stacks up to 3 times.
- **Special:** Killing a burning enemy causes them to explode, spreading Burn.
  \## [💰 Greed](💰ᜄ GA - Greed (Earth) "wikilink")
- **On-hit effect:** **Seed** --- attaches a seed to enemies that grows after 3 seconds, entangling (rooting) them and draining HP to you over time.
- **Penalty:** Each seeded attack reduces your damage by 5% for 2 seconds (stacks, decays slowly). Greed makes you *hungry* but *less sharp*.
  \## [✨ Pride](✨ᜎ LA - Pride (Lightning) "wikilink")
- **On-hit effect:** **Chain Crit** --- critical hits chain lightning to one nearby enemy, chance to stun.
- **Special:** Precision hits (headshots/weak points) guarantee crit chain once every 6 seconds.
  \## [🌑 Envy](🌑 ᜐ SA - Envy (Shadow) "wikilink")
- **On-hit effect:** **Corrode** --- reduces enemy armor by 15% per stack (max 3 stacks). At max stacks, armor *shatters*, leaving them vulnerable (+50% damage taken) for 3 seconds.

  \## [🌊 Gluttony](🌊ᜂ U - Gluttony (Water) "wikilink")
- **On-hit effect:** **Devour** --- each hit steals a small amount of health and stores it as **Gluttony Charge** (max 10). At max charges, your next ability releases a **Devouring Tide** wave that knocks back and damages all nearby enemies.
- **Penalty:** Taking damage while at high Gluttony Charge causes you to lose all charges and be briefly slowed.
  \## [❄ Sloth](❄ᜉ PA - Sloth (Ice) "wikilink")
- **On-hit effect:** **Frostbite** --- slows enemy by 25% and applies a stack of Frostbite. At 3 stacks, enemy becomes **Brittle** (+30% damage taken from all sources) for 4 seconds.
