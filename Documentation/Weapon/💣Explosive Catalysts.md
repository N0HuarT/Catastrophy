### 🎯 Fantasy
- Power that poisons your own battlefield
- Area denial through self-inflicted danger
### ⚡ Attack
- **Tap:** jumping bomb → bounces, explodes after delay
- **Hold:** short-fused / volatile bomb → explodes on impact
### 🔄 Reload / Mechanics
- No traditional ammo
- Reload = **behavioral cleanup**
- Reload action stabilizes the field:
    - Existing hazards shrink, fade, collapse, or get reclaimed
- Firing more explosives reduces available safe space
- Reloading reclaims space, not power
### ⚠ Weakness / Cons
- Limited safe throws before self-risk
- Vulnerable while reclaiming space
- Panic spam makes movement dangerous
### 🧩 Tricks / Weapon Mechanics
- Power now, pain later
- Skilled players manage **when** to dirty the field and **when** to clean it
- Battlefield control is the real resource
