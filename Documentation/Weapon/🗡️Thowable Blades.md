### 🎯 Fantasy
- Fast, mobile ranged weapon with skill emphasis
- Dual-hand rhythm, throw → recover
### ⚡ Attack
- **Tap:** throw one blade (alternates hands if possible)
- **Hold:** throw all blades from one hand in a fan/shotgun pattern
### 🔄 Reload / Mechanics
- Ammo is split per hand (e.g. 4L/4R)
- Two reload modes:
    1. **Tap Reload:** restore 1 blade to one hand (fast, low commitment)
    2. **Hold Reload:** restore all blades to both hands (slow, risky)
- Both hands loaded → faster attack cadence
- One hand empty → slower follow-up throws
### ⚠ Weakness / Cons
- Moderate range
- Precision required
- Emptying one hand reduces fire rate
- Greedy reloads create vulnerability
### 🧩 Tricks / Weapon Mechanics
- **Tap–Tap–Tap:** rapid alternating throws
- **Hold Attack:** dump one hand for burst damage
- Smart players avoid emptying both hands unless committing
- Skill = managing **which hand is empty, and when**
