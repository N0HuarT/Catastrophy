### 🎯 Thematics / Fantasy
- Devastating burst weapon; magical “gun” feel
- Aggressive, high-risk, high-reward
### ⚡ Attack
- **Tap:** standard shot → quick, moderate burst
- **Hold:** aim for longer range → higher accuracy / damage at a distance
### 🔄 Reload / Mechanics
- Magazine: 5 shots + 1 in chamber (max 6)
- Can leave 1 ammo in chamber for tactical mobility / dodges
- Reload: ~1.8–2.2s
- Cannot dodge freely while reloading → vulnerable window
- Mobility trick: shoot floor while reloading → propel yourself
- No ammo UI; timing and positioning matter
### ⚠ Weakness / Cons
- Short-range accuracy
- Resource-heavy
- Vulnerable during reload
### 🧩 Tricks / Weapon Mechanics
- Decide whether to leave 1 in chamber for mobility → emergent skill
- Knockback yourself strategically for dodges / repositioning
- Burst pacing: fire → panic → dodge → reload
