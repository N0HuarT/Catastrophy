### 🎯 Thematics / Fantasy
- Calculated, high-precision strikes; timing matters    
- Aim → commit → recover
- Pure skill weapon; emphasizes patience and precision
### ⚡ Attack
- **Tap:** quick shot → fast, low-risk, moderate damage
- **Hold:** charged shot → higher damage, higher crit chance, longer vulnerability
### 🔄 Reload / Mechanics
- “Reload” = nocking a new arrow
- **Tap:** nock a single arrow quickly → minimal recovery
- **Hold:** ready a precision arrow → slower, but max damage / crit potential
- Can nock safely when idle
- Recovery time after nock = vulnerability window
- No ammo UI; all tactile, feel-based
### ⚠ Weakness / Cons
- Slow attack speed compared to other ranged weapons
- Punishing on misses
- Vulnerable during charged shots and nocking
### 🧩 Tricks / Weapon Mechanics
- Timing is skill-based → tap/hold decides risk vs reward
- Charged shots can break weak points or trigger critical combos
- No ammo management needed → pure positioning, timing, and decision-making
