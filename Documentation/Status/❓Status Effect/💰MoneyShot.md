On hit / on kill, there’s a chance to spawn **extra resources** (currency, ammo, crafting scrap) from the target.
**Mechanics:**

- **On hit**: Small chance (e.g., 5%) to drop a minor resource.
- **On kill**: Higher chance (e.g., 25%) to drop a larger resource bundle.
- Resources are **auto-collected** if in pickup range.

**Visual/audio:** Golden spark/sound on proc.
