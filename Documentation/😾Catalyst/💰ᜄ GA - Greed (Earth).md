**Fantasy:** hoarding wealth, efficiency at a cost
- **Primary Gain**
    - **Pickup Radius** greatly increased.
    - All ammo/currency pickups grant **+15% bonus** (e.g., 10 bullets become 11–12).
    - Enemies drop **extra loot** (additional ammo, crafting scraps, or currency).
- **Secondary Effects**
    - **Weapon efficiency** improved: 25% chance not to consume ammo on hit.
    - Reloading is 20% faster.
    - **Accumulation Shield**: Picking up loot grants a small stacking shield (decays after 5 seconds of no pickups).
- **Distortion / Penalty (Stress-Driven)**
    - **Stress** builds each time you pick up loot, gain ammo, or collect currency.
    - At **Medium Stress**: Your **movement speed slows by 10%** (weighed down by greed).
    - At **High Stress**: Enemies are **magnetically drawn to dropped loot** near you, gaining temporary buffs if they reach it first.
    - At **Max Stress**: **Hoarding Backlash** — you drop 30% of your carried ammo/currency on the ground, and cannot re-attune to Greed for 30 seconds.
- **Stress Reduction**
    - Spending resources (buying, crafting, using consumables).
    - Going 10 seconds without picking anything up.
    - Switching away from Greed.
