# **The 7 Catalysts — Core Identity**
- 1 _Active Catalyst_ (equipped / Attuned) 
- 2 _Bound Catalysts_ (passive AI units)
- You issue **commands**, not micromanage
- **1 Active Catalyst** → modifies weapon + grants Signature Spell
- **2 Passive Catalysts** → autonomous, evasive, light attacks
- Command one of the 2 Catalyst to cast its spell (Q/E/1/2)
- Equipped Catalyst = Attunement
Each Catalyst is defined by:
- **Primary Gain** — what players actively want
- **Secondary Effects** — supporting stats (HP, CDR, accuracy, etc.)
- **Distortion / Penalty** — why pure builds are dangerous
- **Design Role** — the gameplay fantasy it fulfills




# 😾Catalist
## [[🔥ᜃ KA - Wrath (Fire)|🔥 Wrath]]
- **On-hit effect:** **Burn** — damage-over-time fire effect, stacks up to 3 times.
- **Special:** Killing a burning enemy causes them to explode, spreading Burn.
## [[💰ᜄ GA - Greed (Earth)|💰 Greed]]
- **On-hit effect:** **Seed** — attaches a seed to enemies that grows after 3 seconds, entangling (rooting) them and draining HP to you over time.
- **Penalty:** Each seeded attack reduces your damage by 5% for 2 seconds (stacks, decays slowly). Greed makes you _hungry_ but _less sharp_.
## [[✨ᜎ LA - Pride (Lightning)|✨ Pride]]
- **On-hit effect:** **Chain Crit** — critical hits chain lightning to one nearby enemy, chance to stun.
- **Special:** Precision hits (headshots/weak points) guarantee crit chain once every 6 seconds.
## [[🌑 ᜐ SA - Envy (Shadow)|🌑 Envy]]
- **On-hit effect:** **Corrode** — reduces enemy armor by 15% per stack (max 3 stacks). At max stacks, armor _shatters_, leaving them vulnerable (+50% damage taken) for 3 seconds.
- **Special:** Damaging corroded enemies heals you for a small amount (lifesteal). Envy _steals their durability_.
## [[🌪ᜑ HA - Lust (Wind)|🌪 Lust]]
- **On-hit effect:** **Charm Projectile** — projectiles slightly home toward enemies and have increased speed.
- **Special:** Hitting an enemy from behind or the side applies **Seduced** (confuses them for 1.5 seconds).
## [[🌊ᜂ U - Gluttony (Water)|🌊 Gluttony]]
- **On-hit effect:** **Devour** — each hit steals a small amount of health and stores it as **Gluttony Charge** (max 10). At max charges, your next ability releases a **Devouring Tide** wave that knocks back and damages all nearby enemies.
- **Penalty:** Taking damage while at high Gluttony Charge causes you to lose all charges and be briefly slowed.
## [[❄ᜉ PA - Sloth (Ice)|❄ Sloth]]
- **On-hit effect:** **Frostbite** — slows enemy by 25% and applies a stack of Frostbite. At 3 stacks, enemy becomes **Brittle** (+30% damage taken from all sources) for 4 seconds.
- **Special:** Brittle enemies that die shatter, spreading Frostbite to nearby foes.
