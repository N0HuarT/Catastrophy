**Fantasy:** overwhelming force, unstable focus

- **Primary Gain**
    - All attacks apply **Burn** (damage-over-time fire effect, stacks up to 3 times).
    - **+30% base weapon damage** while Wrath is active.
- **Secondary Effects**
    - Burned enemies have a chance to **explode on death**, spreading Burn to nearby foes.
    - Killing a burning enemy reduces ability cooldowns slightly.
- **Distortion / Penalty (Stress-Driven)**
    - **Stress** builds each time you fire/reload/use an ability.
    - At **Medium Stress**: 10% chance for shots/spells to **misfire** (consume ammo/mana but deal no damage).[[😾Mechanics]]
    - At **High Stress**: misfire chance increases to 25%, and misfires cause **self-damage** (minor DoT Burn on yourself).
    - At **Max Stress**: forced Catalyst swap; cannot re-attune to Wrath for 30 seconds.
- **Stress Reduction**
    - Switching away from Wrath.
    - Going 5 seconds without attacking.
    - Using a non-damaging ability (e.g., Sloth’s Ice Block).
