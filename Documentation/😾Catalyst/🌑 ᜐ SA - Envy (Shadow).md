F**antasy:** stealing advantages, corrosive resentment
- **Primary Gain**
    - **Armor Shred**: Your attacks reduce enemy armor by 10% per hit (stacks up to 50% reduction).
    - Attacking enemies with active buffs **steals** one buff for yourself for 8 seconds.
- **Secondary Effects**
    - Enemies with reduced armor are **Corroded**, taking damage over time.
    - Killing a corroded enemy spreads the poison to nearby foes.
    - You deal **+20% damage** to enemies who have higher current health or stronger buffs than you.
- **Distortion / Penalty (Stress-Driven)**
    - **Stress** builds each time you steal a buff or apply armor shred.
    - At **Medium Stress**: Stolen buffs last **50% shorter**.
    - At **High Stress**: Poison can backfire — damaging you if no poisoned enemy dies within 5 seconds.
    - At **Max Stress**: **Resentful Collapse** — you lose all stolen buffs and your armor is reduced to zero for 10 seconds; cannot re-attune to Envy for 30 seconds.
- **Stress Reduction**
    - Killing an enemy you've stolen a buff from.
    - Having no stolen buffs active for 10 seconds.
    - Switching away from Envy.
