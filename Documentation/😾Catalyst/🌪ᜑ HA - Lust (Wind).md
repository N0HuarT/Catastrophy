**Fantasy:** seductive motion, irresistible momentum

- **Primary Gain**
    
    - **Movement speed increased by 25%** while Lust is active.
    - Dodging or dashing leaves a **Charming Echo** that taunts enemies for 2 seconds.
        
- **Secondary Effects**
    
    - Enemies near your Charming Echo are **Slowed by 30%** and take **15% more damage**.
        
    - Rapid movement (sprinting/dashing for 2+ seconds) grants a **Momentum Shield** that absorbs one instance of damage.
        
    - Hitting an enemy from behind or the side applies **Seduced** (they wander aimlessly for 1.5 seconds).
        
- **Distortion / Penalty (Stress-Driven)**
    
    - **Stress** builds each time you dash, dodge, or move at max speed for over 3 seconds continuously.
        
    - At **Medium Stress**: Charming Echo duration reduced by 50%.
        
    - At **High Stress**: Enemies immune to Seduced; Momentum Shield breaks twice as fast.
        
    - At **Max Stress**: **Exhaustion** — movement speed halved and you cannot dash for 10 seconds; cannot re-attune to Lust for 30 seconds.
        
- **Stress Reduction**
    
    - Standing still for 3 seconds.
        
    - Switching away from Lust.
        
    - Hitting enemies with melee or close-range attacks.
